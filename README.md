# This software is not a virus.

Your antivirus might warn you because the program uses system-level functions to control the mouse and keyboard (via libraries like `pynput` and `keyboard`).

pynput: for hiding crosshair by holding **Right Mouse Button**

keyboard: for **F2** and **F3**

This is not malicious — it is required for the program to function properly.

If you downloaded this from a trusted source, it is safe to run.
